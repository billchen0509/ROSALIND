###
Let Fn be the number of rabbits in the nth generation. We have F1=F2=1 by the problem definition.

The total pairs of rabbit at any given month is the sum of rabbits from the previous generation and their offspring. 

Any pair of rabbits that were alive two generations ago will reproduce and make k rabbit babies. 

Furthermore, these pairs are the only source new rabbits for this generation. 

Since any pair of rabbits alive in the previous generation are still alive this generation, we get the recurrence Fn=Fn−1+k⋅Fn−2
.
